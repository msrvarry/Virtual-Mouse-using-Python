# Virtual Mouse with Hand Gestures


## Overview

The Virtual Mouse project is a Python-based system that enables users to control their computer's mouse movements using hand gestures. By leveraging a webcam and computer vision, this application interprets hand gestures to perform mouse operations seamlessly.

## Features

- **Gesture-Controlled Mouse Movements**: Control mouse movements using hand gestures detected by the webcam.
- **Left Click Functionality**: Execute a left-click operation when the angle between two fingers is less than 15 degrees.
- **Mouse Movement**: Move the mouse cursor when the angle exceeds 15 degrees, providing flexibility in navigating the screen.

## Project Components

- **Python Codebase**: Contains the Python scripts responsible for hand gesture recognition and mouse control.
- **Requirements**: Lists necessary libraries and dependencies required to run the project.
- **Instructions**: Guidelines on setting up and running the application.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure the required libraries and dependencies are installed using the provided instructions.
2. **Run the Application**: Execute the Python script to initiate the webcam interface and begin gesture control.
3. **Perform Gestures**: Control mouse movements by altering the angle between two fingers:
   - Less than 15 degrees: Executes a left-click operation.
   - Greater than 15 degrees: Moves the mouse cursor accordingly.
